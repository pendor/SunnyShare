      <h1>About Sunny+Share</h1>
      
      <p>Like a cache of treasures left behind in the forrest, this is a place of
        digital artifacts of others who have visited this place before you.</p>
    
    	<p>
    	  Sunny+Share is a (usually) solar powered anonymous sharing device.
    	  You're invited to place photos, media, and other digital content that others
    	  in this area may find interesting.  Uploads are visible to anyone within WiFi 
    	  range, but are NOT accessible on the public internet.  When you leave this place,
        like footprints in the forrest, what you share stays behind.</p>
      
      
      <p>Access to this system is anonymous.  No logs are kept.  No personal information 
        is recorded.  Once uploaded, files can only be removed by this device's owner.  
        Please only share content that is appropriate for everyone in this area to view 
        and be mindful of copyright &amp; other applicable laws.  Inappropriate or unlawful 
        content will be removed.  This service may disappear at any time.  Use it at your 
        own risk.  No warranty of any kind is  expressed or implied.  Uploads may be deleted 
        at any time.
